## Projects That I Have Done

### HTML/CSS/JS

- I created this website by hand typed (in Atom) HTML5, CSS3, and a little bit of Javascript.
- For a Course at KU I made a BMI calculator using [Javascript](http://jason-savage.com/bmi/bmi.html) and then converted it to using [PHP](http://jason-savage.com/bmi/bmi.php).
- [The University of Kansas Information Security Club's Website](https://github.com/JSavage42/kuisc).

#### React

- [QuestionAir](https://github.com/JSavage42/questionair). A project for a professor to create tests and host tests and allow students to take them. Currently in development.
- [HAWKU](https://github.com/JSavage42/hawku). Senior Capstone Project for The University of Kansas. HAWKU stands for Handy Anomaly Widgit for KU. Currently in pre-alpha development.
- [React-mysql-boilerplate](https://github.com/JSavage42/react-mysql-boilerplate). A boilerplate React app that uses Express to make AJAX calls to a MySQL database.

### Powershell

- I wrote a couple of PowerShell scripts during my internship in the summer of 2017. I cannot share those since I made them on company time. However, one automated creating a user and adding them to the correct OU in ADUC. Another Script copied the member of from one user and added another user to those groups.

### System Administration and Security

- March 2018, I was a part of a group of 8 who participated in the [At Large Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition](http://www.nationalccdc.org/index.php) where we placed 3rd in a group of about 15 teams from all over the country. My duties were Active Directory and Web Services.
