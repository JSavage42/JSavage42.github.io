## Projects That I Have Done

1. I created this website by hand typed (in Atom) HTML5, CSS3, and a little bit of Javascript.
2. I wrote a couple of PowerShell scripts during my internship in the summer of 2017. I cannot share those since I made them on company time. However, one automated creating a user and adding them to the correct OU in ADUC. Another Script copied the member of from one user and added another user to those groups.
3. March 2018, I was a part of a group of 8 who participated in the [At Large Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition](http://www.nationalccdc.org/index.php) where we placed 3rd in a group of about 15 teams from all over the country. My duties were Active Directory and Web Services.
4. For a Course at KU I made a BMI calculator using [Javascript](http://jason-savage.com/bmi/bmi.html) and then converted it to using [PHP](http://jason-savage.com/bmi/bmi.php).
